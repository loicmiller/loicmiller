This is a fundamental computational problem arising in directed hypergraphs, and is a foundational step in tackling problems of reachability and redundancy. This problem was previously explored in the context of general directed hypergraphs (containing cycles), where it is NP-hard, and acyclic B-hypergraphs, where a linear time algorithm can be achieved. In a surprising contrast, we find that for acyclic F-hypergraphs the problem is NP-hard, which also implies the problem is hard in BF-hypergraphs. This is a striking complexity boundary given that F-hypergraphs and B-hypergraphs would at first seem to be symmetrical to one another. We provide the proof of complexity and explain why there is a fundamental asymmetry between the two classes of directed hypergraphs.","tags":["directed hypergraphs","hypernetworks","complexity","NP-completeness"],"title":"Finding (s,d)-Hypernetworks in F-Hypergraphs is NP-Hard","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Loïc Miller","Pascal Mérindol","Antoine Gallais","Cristel Pelsser"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.

Those processes often involve partnerships with other companies, and can be modeled as workflows where the owner of the data at risk interacts with contractors to realize a sequence of tasks on the data to be secured. In this paper, we first show how those workflows can be deployed and enforced while preventing data exposure. Second, this paper provides a global framework to enable the verification of workflow policies. Following the principles of zero-trust, we develop an infrastructure using the isolation provided by a microservice architecture to enforce owner policy. We implement a workflow with our infrastructure in a publicly available proof of concept. This work allows us to verify that the specified policy is correctly enforced by testing the deployment for policy violations, and find the overhead cost of authorization to be reasonable for the benefits. In addition, this paper presents a way to verify policies using a suite of tools transforming and checking policies as metagraphs. It is evident from the results that our verification method is very efficient regarding the size of the policies. Overall, this infrastructure and the mechanisms that verify the policy is correctly enforced, and then correctly implemented, help us deploy workflows in the cloud securely.","tags":["Data leak","Workflow","Microservices","Authorization","Access Control","Policy Verification","Metagraphs","YAWL","Rego"],"title":"Securing Workflows Using Microservices and Metagraphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Loïc Miller","Pascal Mérindol","Antoine Gallais","Cristel Pelsser"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1632328200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1632328200,"objectID":"bdc5d8b0b671ad0af80f1be6295ecb4b","permalink":"https://loicmiller.com/talk/de-lutilisation-des-metagraphes-pour-la-verification-de-politiques-de-securite/","publishdate":"2021-08-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/de-lutilisation-des-metagraphes-pour-la-verification-de-politiques-de-securite/","section":"event","summary":"Les processus métier multi-agents aux interactions complexes sont généralement modélisés en tant que workflows.

In this work, we develop a taxonomy of attacks combining hijacks with blackholing: BGP blackjacks (blackhole hijacks). We show that those attacks effectively grant more reach and stealth to the attacker than regular hijacks, and assess the usability of those attacks in various security deployments. We then find that routing security mechanisms for BGP do not provide an adequate protection against some of those attacks, and propose additional mechanisms to properly defend against or mitigate them.","tags":["BGP","Security","Blackholing","DDoS","Communities","Hijacks","Leaks"],"title":"BGP Blackholing Attack Defense","type":"event"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://loicmiller.com/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
