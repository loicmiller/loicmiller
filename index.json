This is a fundamental computational problem arising in directed hypergraphs, and is a foundational step in tackling problems of reachability and redundancy. This problem was previously explored in the context of general directed hypergraphs (containing cycles), where it is NP-hard, and acyclic B-hypergraphs, where a linear time algorithm can be achieved. In a surprising contrast, we find that for acyclic F-hypergraphs the problem is NP-hard, which also implies the problem is hard in BF-hypergraphs. This is a striking complexity boundary given that F-hypergraphs and B-hypergraphs would at first seem to be symmetrical to one another. We provide the proof of complexity and explain why there is a fundamental asymmetry between the two classes of directed hypergraphs.","tags":["directed hypergraphs","hypernetworks","complexity","NP-completeness"],"title":"Finding (s,d)-Hypernetworks in F-Hypergraphs is NP-Hard","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Loïc Miller","Pascal Mérindol","Antoine Gallais","Cristel Pelsser"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1639180800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1639180800,"objectID":"881a3b225eccc2cf68ccc3e62c5decdb","permalink":"https://loicmiller.com/publication/securing-workflows-using-microservices-and-metagraphs/","publishdate":"2021-12-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/securing-workflows-using-microservices-and-metagraphs/","section":"publication","summary":"Companies such as Netflix increasingly use the cloud to deploy their business processes.

Those efforts culminated in the design of security protocols and infrastructures such as the Transport Security Layer (TLS) protocol, or the Public Key Infrastructure, as well as policy enforcement mechanisms such as the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML), Access Control Lists (ACLs), firewall rules and many more.\nAll those security mechanisms quickly become very hard to configure, manage and monitor, as well as losing flexibility over time, especially in the context of a workflow. In addition to the complexity of such a system, data leaks occur more and more often. Those leaks are perceived as huge losses of money for businesses like the movie industry, and must be prevented in order to achieve a truly secure workflow system.\nIn order to achieve all those desirable security properties, we turn to the world of microservices, which can provide us with all those security benefits while maintaining a streamlined design and flexibility. This containerized environment allows service streamlining, while container orchestrators and service meshes allow us to create and manage identities and policies, as well as having a flexible telemetry system in the form of tracing, monitoring and logging.\nOne thing the microservice architecture does not solve is the verification of the correctness of policies, a problem we are aiming to demonstrate and solve. This work presents how the microservice architecture can help us achieve a secure and leak-free workflow.","tags":["Workflow","Security","Data leak","Microservices","Access control"],"title":"Securing Workflows Using Microservices","type":"event"},{"authors":["Loïc Miller","Cristel Pelsser"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1569236100,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1569236100,"objectID":"c86004f3eb8566fda87f2b90073d5ef6","permalink":"https://loicmiller.com/talk/a-taxonomy-of-attacks-using-bgp-blackholing/","publishdate":"2021-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/a-taxonomy-of-attacks-using-bgp-blackholing/","section":"event","summary":"BGP blackholing is a common technique used to mitigate DDoS attacks.

You can focus on the content and Wowchemy handles the rest.\nHighlight your code snippets, take notes on math classes, and draw diagrams from textual representation.\nOn this page, you’ll find some examples of the types of technical content that can be rendered with Wowchemy.\nExamples Code Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for highlighting code syntax. You can customize the styles under the syntax_highlighter option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() ``` renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026#34;data.csv\u0026#34;) data.head() Mindmaps Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for mindmaps.\nSimply insert a Markdown markmap code block and optionally set the height of the mindmap as shown in the example below.\nA simple mindmap defined as a Markdown list:\n```markmap {height=\u0026#34;200px\u0026#34;} - Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal ``` renders as\n- Hugo Modules - wowchemy - wowchemy-plugins-netlify - wowchemy-plugins-netlify-cms - wowchemy-plugins-reveal A more advanced mindmap with formatting, code blocks, and math:\n```markmap - Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ ``` renders as\n- Mindmaps - Links - [Wowchemy Docs](https://wowchemy.com/docs/) - [Discord Community](https://discord.gg/z8wNYzb) - [GitHub](https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-themes) - Features - Markdown formatting - **inline** ~~text~~ *styles* - multiline text - `inline code` - ```js console.log(\u0026#39;hello\u0026#39;); console.log(\u0026#39;code block\u0026#39;); ``` - Math: $x = {-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2-4ac} \\over 2a}$ Charts Wowchemy supports the popular Plotly format for interactive charts.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example line-chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026#34;line-chart\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\nYou might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.yaml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$...${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} or {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$$...$${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}}, respectively. (We wrap the LaTeX math in the Wowchemy math shortcode to prevent Hugo rendering our math as Markdown. The math shortcode is new in v5.5-dev.)\nExample math block:\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$ \\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2} $$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$ Example inline math {{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}}$\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})${{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the math linebreak (\\\\):\n{{\u0026lt; math \u0026gt;}} $$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$ {{\u0026lt; /math \u0026gt;}} renders as\n$$ f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases} $$ Diagrams Wowchemy supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ``` renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!

Those efforts culminated in the design of security protocols and infrastructures such as the Transport Security Layer (TLS) protocol, or the Public Key Infrastructure, as well as policy enforcement mechanisms such as the eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML), Access Control Lists (ACLs), firewall rules and many more.\nAll those security mechanisms quickly become very hard to configure, manage and monitor, as well as losing flexibility over time, especially in the context of a workflow. In addition to the complexity of such a system, data leaks occur more and more often. Those leaks are perceived as huge losses of money for businesses like the movie industry, and must be prevented in order to achieve a truly secure workflow system.\nIn order to achieve all those desirable security properties, we turn to the world of microservices, which can provide us with all those security benefits while maintaining a streamlined design and flexibility. This containerized environment allows service streamlining, while container orchestrators and service meshes allow us to create and manage identities and policies, as well as having a flexible telemetry system in the form of tracing, monitoring and logging.\nOne thing the microservice architecture does not solve is the verification of the correctness of policies, a problem we are aiming to demonstrate and solve. This work presents how the microservice architecture can help us achieve a secure and leak-free workflow.","tags":["Workflow","Security","Data leak","Microservices","Access control"],"title":"Securing Workflows Using the Microservices Architecture","type":"event"},{"authors":["Loïc Miller"],"categories":[],"content":"from IPython.core.display import Image Image(\u0026#39;https://www.python.org/static/community_logos/python-logo-master-v3-TM-flattened.png\u0026#39;) print(\u0026#34;Welcome to Academic!\u0026#34;) Welcome to Academic!

Generally, the victim sends in a request for traffic to the attacked IP(s) to be dropped. Unfortunately, remote parties may misuse blackholing and send requests for IPs they do not own, turning a defense technique into a new attack vector. As DDoS attacks grow in number, blackholing will only become more popular, creating a greater risk this service will be exploited. In this work, we develop a taxonomy of attacks combining hijacks with blackholing: BGP blackjacks (blackhole hijacks). We show that those attacks effectively grant more reach and stealth to the attacker than regular hijacks, and assess the usability of those attacks in various security deployments.
