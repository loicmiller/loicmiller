The module "Blockchain and Consensus" is aimed at $2^{nd}$ and $3^{rd}$ year students from all engineering tracks at the Rennes campus, in particular the "Digital platforms: technologies and markets" specialization. This training program aims to train engineers on the technical (networks, virtualization, cloud), economic, and legal aspects of digital platforms. The module also welcomes students from the specialized master's degree in cybersecurity, co-organized by IMT Atlantique and CentraleSup√©lec. More specifically, this module presents the fundamental concepts of blockchains -- the principles of distributed systems (processes, communication, failures), consensus mechanisms, as well as smart contract development with the Solidity language.

In this module, I delivered a 3h lecture on the topic of sharding in blockchains, for which I created the course materials. The content was designed with a heterogeneous audience in mind, accessible to $2^{nd}$-year students while offering a deeper level for $3^{rd}$-year students. I first presented the issues of blockchain scalability (e.g. throughput), the metrics and trade-offs associated with these issues, then the concept of sharding and its variants. I also detailed several solutions (Elastico, RapidChain) and presented forms of sharding in different contexts (public/private blockchains, permissioned or not).
