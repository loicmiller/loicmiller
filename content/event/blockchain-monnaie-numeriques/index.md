summary: []
abstract: "As the European Union develops a legal framework for crypto-assets and data protection, the technological question underlying the emergence of a genuine digital currency remains open. Blockchain today stands as an interdisciplinary field of study at the crossroads of computer science, economics, and law. This presentation will place the ongoing regulatory framework in perspective with the technical barriers that still hinder the adoption of blockchains, namely scalability, sustainability, and interoperability. The aim is to show that, alongside the construction of a European legal order for blockchain, the very possibility of a practical and widespread use of this technology depends on overcoming these fundamental challenges."
